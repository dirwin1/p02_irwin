Welcome to Insane Scatter Plot V1.0!!

Insane Scatter Plot was written in Swift using the new SwiftUI framework from XCode 11

To Use: Enter coordinates at the x and y input fields and press "Add Point" to add a new point to the graph.
    The new point will be added to the list of points and automatically be sorted by xValue. The graph will also update
    and adjust its scale to fit the new point if necessary.
    Points can be part of 4 different groups which are indicated by the colored circle next to each point in the list.
    Points will default to red when inserted, but can be changed by tapping the item in the list.
    Points can also be deleted from the list by dragging the list entry to the left
    Tapping or dragging on the graph will draw the (x, y) position of your touch at the position of the touch.

Other cool stuff:
    Light/Dark mode

Note:
    First two days of commits are not recorded due to updating XCode and needing to do a force
